### Project Description
SafeSpace: Your Trusted Travel Companion for Women

SafeSpace is a dedicated platform designed to help women travelers find safe and reliable accommodations with ease. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a secure place to stay or want to list your own women-friendly hostel, SafeSpace connects you with verified options. Explore hostels based on location, reviews, and safety ratings, access contact details, and share your own experiences to help fellow travelers. Our mission is to create a supportive community where safety and comfort come first, making travel stress-free for women everywhere.

### The Problem statement
Women travelers often face challenges in finding safe and reliable accommodations, with limited access to verified information on security, reviews, and trusted recommendations. Existing platforms lack a dedicated focus on women‚Äôs safety, leaving them vulnerable to uncertain lodging options. Additionally, hostel owners who prioritize women‚Äôs safety struggle to reach their target audience effectively.


### The Solution
SafeSpace aims to bridge this gap by providing a trusted platform where women can easily find, review, and book safe accommodations while allowing hostel owners to list their properties, ensuring transparency and security¬†in¬†travel.
